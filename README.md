This repository contains a web application built using Streamlit that leverages an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to predict stock prices. The application allows users to upload historical stock data in CSV format, process the data, and make predictions about future stock prices.

##Features

    Data Upload: Upload a CSV file containing historical stock data.
    
    Data Preprocessing: Automatically calculate technical indicators like SMA, RSI, MACD, and ATR.
    
    Model Training: Train an LSTM model on the uploaded data.
    
    Prediction: Predict future stock prices and calculate the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and price direction accuracy.
    
    Visualization: Visualize the actual and predicted stock prices on an interactive plot.
    
    Recommendation: Get a recommendation (Buy, Sell, Hold) based on the model's prediction.
